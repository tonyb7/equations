    rooms_info

    - Map room_id -> game info
    - See handle_start_game for the specific fields in game info
    - Notably, game info stores player names, spectator names, and socketids
        of all sockets that are connected to it
    - Room_id is unmapped whenever socketid list becomes empty
    - Room_id is mapped when a user creates the room and joins it (these two events
        should happen at the same time. So a mapped room_id should never have an
        empty socketid list)
    - Game info also keeps track of whether a game has started
"""

"""
    user_info

    - Map username -> latest socketid for each room, gameroom.
    - A user can be *playing* in any number of games at a time, and those games are
        tracked in the "gamerooms" list, which is set of room ids
    - All rooms that the user is in (spectating or playing) will be tracked in
        the "rooms" dict, which maps room ids to list of socketids.
    - A user will always be in this map as long as he/she has at least one 
        active socket connection (one item in the rooms dict) and at least one
        of its games in the gamerooms list is still active.
    - A game in the gamerooms list will stay there until the game finishes.
    - In summary, username will be mapped whenever a user makes his/her
        first connection, regardless of whether that connection is to join a room
        as a spectator or as a player.
    - And username will be unmapped when that user has no more live connections
        AND the user is no longer a player in any active games.
    - There is one more field in user_info, which is the "room_modes" dict,
        which maps, for every room the player is in, a room id to one of the
        below *_MODE constants
