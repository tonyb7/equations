# Please read:
# For this to work, you need Postgres
# Create a postgres database locally
#    Using the Postgres CLI, that could look like:
#    $ psql
#    # create database eq_dev;
#    CREATE DATABASE
#    # \q
#
# This script assumes that the database is called "eq_dev"
# If your database is named differently (if you are using a production database
#   hosted on AWS, for example), change the DATABASE_URL below
